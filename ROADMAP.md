## Future (2027+)

### Native PM5 Companion App

**Status**: Concept / Research  
**Estimated Timeline**: 2027

iOS/Android app that connects directly to Concept2 PM5 monitors via Bluetooth to enable:

1. **Real-time split streaming** - Stream workout data live to RowLab web dashboard during erg sessions
2. **Push workout configurations** - Send pre-built workouts from RowLab directly to the erg monitor
3. **Wireless erg racing** - Synchronize multiple ergs to start/race together with countdown
4. **Live leaderboard display** - Show real-time leaderboard during team erg sessions on any screen

#### Technical Considerations

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Protocol | Bluetooth LE (CSAFE protocol) |
| SDK | Concept2 has SDK documentation for third-party apps |
| Framework | React Native or Flutter for cross-platform |
| Backend | Real-time WebSocket connection to RowLab for live data streaming |

#### Dependencies

| Dependency | Status | Notes |
|------------|--------|-------|
| Live Workout Dashboard | Pending | Data consumer must be built first |
| Concept2 Developer Partnership | Pending | May need developer approval/partnership |
| Phase 8: Mobile App Foundation | Pending | Core mobile infrastructure required |

#### Use Cases

- **Practice Sessions**: Coach sees all rowers' splits in real-time on the RowLab dashboard
- **Erg Tests**: Synchronized starts ensure fair 2k/6k tests with live rankings
- **Team Racing**: Fun competition mode with head-to-head display
- **Remote Athletes**: Athletes training at home can still join team sessions

#### Competitive Advantage

No existing rowing platform offers native PM5 integration with live coaching dashboard. This would position RowLab as the only end-to-end platform for both on-water and erg training management.

### Shell Margin Visualization

**Status**: Concept / Backlog  
**Priority**: P3  
**Estimated Effort**: Large (10-15 days)

Visual representation of time/distance margins between boats during water workouts, accounting for shell type differences.

#### Features

| Feature | Description | Effort |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| Distance margin conversion | Convert time gaps to physical distance (e.g., "1V beat 2V by 2.3 seconds = ~8 meters") | Medium |
| Shell type speed adjustment | Account for baseline speed differences between shell types (8+ vs 4+ vs 4- vs 2x) | Medium |
| Visual margin representation | Show boats spaced by their actual margin in an intuitive visualization | Medium |
| Animated race replay | Replay showing how margins changed throughout pieces | Large |
| "What-if" analysis | "If 2V maintained their piece 1 pace, they would have won by X meters" | Medium |

#### Technical Considerations

- **Speed/velocity models**: Need baseline speed data for different shell types at various stroke rates
- **Margin calculation**: `time_gap * boat_speed = distance_margin`
- **Environmental factors**: May need to account for water conditions, head/tail wind
- **Future integration**: Could integrate with GPS data from SpeedCoach or NK devices

#### Use Cases

1. **Race analysis**: Help coaches understand how close races actually were
2. **Pacing feedback**: Identify where boats gained/lost margin during pieces
3. **Fair comparison**: Compare performance across different shell types fairly
4. **Training decisions**: Data-driven boat selection and lineup changes

#### Dependencies

- Regatta Day Mode (Phase 3) for live timing data
- Integration Hub (Phase 4) for potential SpeedCoach/NK device data
